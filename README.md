## Welcome!

Hi there! I'm Alisha, a peer-reviewed published researcher and data analyst with a strong background in public health research, predictive modeling, and quantitative methods. I specialize in transforming complex health
  datasets into meaningful, actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare and population health.

## Public Health Focus Areas

My work is driven by a passion for improving health outcomes through data. I focus on:

- üè• **Healthcare Utilization & Outcomes**:  
  Analyzing how demographic and behavioral factors influence healthcare access, treatment outcomes, and disparities.

- üìä **Predictive Analytics in Public Health**:  
  Building and validating models that predict risk, behavior, and outcomes using large-scale health datasets.

- üìÖ **Time Series & Policy Evaluation**:  
  Using ITS models to assess the effects of policy changes or public health interventions over time.

- üìã **Survey Data Analysis**:  
  Working with complex, nationally representative datasets to identify trends in youth behavior, maternal and child health, chronic disease, and more.
